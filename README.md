To run the Python code within a file that is in the same directory as `InMemoryDB.py`, import the `InMemoryDB` class with the line `from InMemoryDB import InMemoryDB`. Then, initialize an instance of the object as `inmemoryDB = InMemoryDB()`. Alternatively, navigate in commandline to the directory that `InMemoryDB.py` is in, and launch the Python interpreter. Use the commands `import InMemoryDB` and `inmemoryDB = InMemoryDB.InMemoryDB()`. After setting up the object either in a file or in the command line, call the functions on `inmemoryDB` as desired.

The instructions could be made clearer if this were made an official assignment. Currently, the descriptions of the functions to be implemented are given in a random order. Details about the same function are at times broken up in different bullet points; for example, the functionality of `put` is described in point 3 and point 5. I think it would make more sense to have a bulleted list of all of the functions, and to have an indented description of each of them directly below where they are introduced, similar to how a `man` file is written. Also, the instructions say that only one transaction may exist at a time, but does not clarify what should happen if `begin_transaction` is called when another transaction is in progress.
